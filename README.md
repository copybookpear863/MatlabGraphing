# MatlabGraphing
This is a graph setup that uses code to automate plots using the Matlab programming language. 
An example of what it should look like is in the GraphTemplate.jpg file. 
The GraphingTemplate.pdf file has the code, and you can download it by downloading the GraphingTemplate.mlx file and opening it in Matlab.
